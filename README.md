Udacity Project 3: Arcade Game Clone

    Description: Frogger:

    1). Download all files in the zipped folder.

    2). Open index.html in a browser mentioned above.

    3). Use the arrow keys to control the player character. If you hit any bugs, you'll be sent back
    to the start and your score will drop by 1. Reach the end and your score will increase by 1 and you
    can play again.

    All that's required to play this game is to ensure that all files are present. To do so, download and unzip the
    zipped folder that contains all of the required files, then open the index.html page in a browser, preferably
    Chrome or Safari.

From here onwards is the original readme provided by Udacity for reference.
